            <h1>Duomo di Milano</h1>
            <p>Milan Cathedral or Metropolitan Cathedral-Basilica of the Nativity of Saint Mary (Italian: Basilica cattedrale metropolitana di Santa Maria Nascente), is the cathedral church of Milan, Lombardy, Italy. Dedicated to the Nativity of St Mary, it is the seat of the Archbishop of Milan, currently Archbishop Mario Delpini.
            <br>
            The Duomo, symbol of Milan in the world, is one of the largest cathedrals in Italy and Europe. Patrimony of Milanese people and humanity, over the centuries it has been expressing, with its magnificence, the devotion of humanity toward the Divine, involving future generations in an endless commitment. The Milan Cathedral, besides being an artistic monument, is a privileged place of prayer, deeply linked to the memory and teachings of the Bishops who succeeded on St. Ambrose's chair, and to the history of the millions of worshippers who, every year, gather in this place to celebrate the Sacred Mysteries. The Cathedral is the mother Church of the Diocese, having a symbolic role of exemplarity both in the life of the city worship, and in relation with the Diocese activity.
            </p>
            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>
                The Duomo of Milan tells a story of faith and art spanning over six centuries. Construction work on the Duomo of Milan probably began in 1386. <br> <br>
                Work for the construction of Milan cathedral began in 1386 when the style of Gothic cathedrals had reached its peak. It was decided that the new church should be built in the area of the ancient basilicas of Santa Maria Maggiore and Santa Tecla, the remains of which, together with those of the Baptistery of San Giovanni alle Fonti, are still visible in the Archaeological Area. <br><br>
                For this purpose, in October 1387 the Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo was founded at the instigation of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Lord of Milan, with the aim of continuing with the design and construction of the church. Gian Galeazzo’s decision to use Candoglia marble instead of the traditional Lombard brick was accompanied by a real revolution in style through the choice of Gothic, which forced the Fabbrica to look for engineers, architects, sculptors and stone-cutters from all around Europe. The construction site became a lively space for the exchange of the most diverse ideas, experiences and skills from workers coming from all over the continent, which made the Duomo a crossroads of peoples and cultures and the most European among Gothic cathedrals.

                    <h1>Leaning Tower of Pisa</h1>
            <p> 
                The Leaning Tower of Pisa is in the city of Pisa, in Tuscany, a region in west-central Italy. More specifically, the tower is on the grounds of the city’s cathedral complex, which is known as the Campo dei Miracoli or Piazza dei Miracoli, the “Square of Miracles.”<br><br>
                Thanks to a pretty impressive design flaw, the Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of Italy’s most iconic sights. Tilting 3.9 degrees off the vertical, the Romanesque bell tower is horizontally displaced by almost four metres and has one side taller than the other. Its precarious position has long fascinated engineers and scientists who, until now, have been unable to explain exactly how the tower has remained standing, particularly after a number of strong earthquakes have hit the area throughout the centuries. <br><br>
                Leaning Tower of Pisa, Italian Torre Pendente di Pisa, medieval structure in Pisa, Italy, that is famous for the settling of its foundations, which caused it to lean 5.5 degrees (about 15 feet [4.5 metres]) from the perpendicular in the late 20th century. Extensive work was subsequently done to straighten the tower, and its lean was ultimately reduced to less than 4.0 degrees. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183 feet 3 inches) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 m (185 ft 11 in) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 tonnes (16,000 short tons).[2] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. </p>
    
                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>Construction of the tower began in 1173, but after work had progressed to the second floor in 1178, it was already starting to sink. Shortly after, the Republic of Pisa was busy battling the likes of Genoa, Lucca and Florence, so construction ceased. Some experts now believe that without this pause, which allowed the soil to settle, the tower would have almost certainly toppled over. <br><br>
                When builders eventually finished the third floor, the tower tipped 0.2 degrees northwest. As efforts were made to correct the tilt, and as the structure grew in height, the tower ended up leaning one degree to the south. <br><br>
                The construction of the tower continued, as did its tilt. Engineers tried to counteract the lean by making the upper floors taller on one side, but the additional weight only caused the foundations to sink further. With the addition of a bell-chamber in 1372, the structure was finally completed. To correct the lean and reduce the risk of collapse, engineers tried a number of tricks, including adding lead counterweights to the base and putting scaffolding on the tower’s weakest parts. By the 1990s though, the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.

            <h1>Carpi</h1>
    <p>A jewel of southern Italy, the island of Capri is famous for many reasons. It has jaw-dropping natural beauty, delicious cuisine and world-class shopping. It’s also a place to see and be seen – there’s a reason why so many celebrities anchor their yachts in Marina Grande. Here is why you should put Capri on your bucket list.<br><br> </p>
        Some of the main features of the island include the Marina Piccola (the little harbour), the Belvedere of Tragara (a high panoramic promenade lined with villas), the limestone crags called sea stacks that project above the sea (the faraglioni), the town of Anacapri, the Blue Grotto (Grotta Azzurra), the ruins of the Imperial Roman villas, and the vistas of various towns surrounding the Island of Capri including Positano, Amalfi, Ravello, Sorrento, Nerano, and Naples.n. Secret Service members are stationed in each room and are available to answer questions about the history and architecture of each room. <br><br>
        <p>Capri is part of the region of Campania, Metropolitan City of Naples. The town of Capri is a comune and the island's main population centre. The island has two harbours, Marina Piccola and Marina Grande (the main port of the island). The separate comune of Anacapri is located high on the hills to the west.</p>

        <h1>History</h1>
        
        <p> Capri was first “discovered” by emperor Augustus in the early years of the Roman Empire. He often resided there and built many temples, villas and gardens as a way of having his own private paradise. Modern excavations however show the island to have been inhibited long before Augustus discovered it. Before the Romans, it was the Greeks who settled on Capri from the 8th century BC onwards, as evidenced by the Phoenician steps that connect Marina Grande with Anacapri (now the current town Capri). Despite its name, archaeologists have confirmed from the stone and its epigraphs, that the steps were in fact built by Greek colonists. It remained a Greek colony until Augustus took it in exchange for Aenaria (Ischia), an island in the Tyrrhenian Sea. <br><br>
        <p>With the end of the Western Roman Empire, Capri returned under the rule of Naples and suffered various attacks by pirates and raiders. Over the years Capri was tossed back and forth between the French and the British, until the end of the Napoleonic era in 1815, when it returned to the Bourbon ruling house of Naples. During the early 19th century the island became popular with wealthy gay men and lesbians, acting as a safe place where they could be more liberal in their sexuality. Its popularity continued in the latter half of the 19th century, when European artists, writers and celebrities flocked to the island for its sun, sea and beautiful flora. One of the most well-known celebrities who resides there today is singer Mariah Carey who owns a villa on the island. Despite the big time gap that separates Mariah to Emperor Augustus, its clear that the island still remains a luxurious jewel in the Bay of Naples, enjoyed by some of the wealthiest of society.</p>

            <h1>Venice</h1>
            <p>Venice is a city in north-eastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region. It is built on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by over 400 bridges.The islands are in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers (more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile).T<br><br>
            Venice, known also as the “City of Canals,” “The Floating City,” and “Serenissima,” is arguably one of Italy’s most picturesque cities. With its winding canals, striking architecture, and beautiful bridges, Venice is a popular destination for travel.<br><br>
            The luminous spectacle of ornate marbled and frescoed palaces, bell towers, and domes reflected in the sparkling waters of the lagoon under a blue Adriatic sky has been painted, photographed, and filmed to such an extent that it is difficult to distinguish the real city from its romantic representations. The visitor arriving in Venice is still transported into another world, one whose atmosphere and beauty remain incomparable. <br><br>
                
            Top 10 facts about Venice: <br><br>

            •	There are 177 canals in Venice. The S-shaped Grand Canal is the biggest and splits the city in two. <br><br>
            •	The San Marco bell tower, or campanile, was built in the 12th century and collapsed in 1902. The tower was rebuilt to be exactly the same as the previous one. It is 98.6 metres tall, making it the fifth tallest bell tower in Italy. <br><br>
            •	Venice is sinking at the rate of 1-2 millimeters a year. <br><br>
            •	The population of Venice has decreased from 120,000 to 60,000 in the last 50 years. Some experts believe Venice could be a ghost town by 2030 with only tourists visiting by day. <br><br>
            •	The first woman in the world that graduated was born in Venice in 1646. <br><br>
            •	The first public casino in the world was opened in Venice in 1638. <br><br>

            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>Although no surviving historical records deal directly with the founding of Venice, tradition and the available evidence have led several historians to agree that the original population of Venice consisted of refugees—from nearby Roman cities such as Padua, Aquileia, Treviso, Altino, and Concordia (modern Portogruaro), as well as from the undefended countryside—who were fleeing successive waves of Germanic and Hun invasions. This is further supported by the documentation on the so-called "apostolic families", the twelve founding families of Venice who elected the first doge, who in most cases trace their lineage back to Roman families. Some late Roman sources reveal the existence of fishermen, on the islands in the original marshy lagoons, who were referred to as incolae lacunae ("lagoon dwellers"). The traditional founding is identified with the dedication of the first church, that of San Giacomo on the islet of Rialto (Rivoalto, "High Shore")—said to have taken place at the stroke of noon on 25 March 421 (the Feast of the Annunciation)</p>

            <h1>Salami</h1>
            <p>Salami is a sausage that was invented in Italy. In the original idea, it was made from a mixture of chopped pork and salt, which was carefully air dried in a case, but mass production turned it into a semi-finished product either for sandwiches and pizza. <br><br>
                The name “salami” comes from the Italian word salare, which means “to salt”. 
                In general, this word hides not one particular type of sausage, but a whole “family”, this is a term describing any type of meat product in case. Like many other Italian foods, salami has a long history, dating back to before Ancient Rome. Over the centuries, many variations have appeared on the theme of this type of sausage, each region has its own and sometimes even more than one.

It was only during the Etruscan period that the first forms of non-nomadic breeding began to develop, for example, for trade. An interesting find was made by archaeologists, during the excavations of Forcello (V century BC) in the province of Mantua, 50,000 animal bones were found, 60% of which are pigs. <br><br>

            <h1>Pizza</h1>
            <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo. <br><br>
            In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.<br><br>
            The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[4] Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries.[5] It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe, North America and Australasia; available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, via pizza delivery, and as street food.[5] Various food companies sell ready-baked pizzas, which may be frozen, in grocery stores, to be reheated in a home oven. <br><br>

                </p>
            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>The history of pizza begins in antiquity, as various ancient cultures produced basic flatbreads with several toppings.<br><br> 
                A precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia, a flatbread known to the Romans as panis focacius, to which toppings were then added. Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century. <br><br> 
                The word pizza was first documented in 997 AD in Gaeta and successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods. <br><br>

                Tiramisu  is a coffee-flavoured Italian dessert. It is made of ladyfingers (savoiardi) dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of eggs, sugar, and mascarpone cheese, flavoured with cocoa. The recipe has been adapted into many varieties of cakes and other desserts. Its origins are often disputed among Italian regions Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia.Tiramisu is one of the most famous Italian dessert in the world, born in Treviso (a lovely town near Venice), delicious and easy to make. <br><br>
                There are many variations of the tiramisu recipe. The following is the authentic Italian tiramisu recipe, the one you make on Sundays, the one you eat when you come to Italy, made with eggs and mascarpone cheese. <br><br>

            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>The word Tiramisù literally means “pick me up”. It comes from the Treviso dialect, “Tireme su”, Italianised into Tiramisù in the latter half of the 20th century.

            <h1>Lasgana</h1>
            <p> The origins of the word lasagne or lasagna can be traced back to Ancient Greece. What we know as lasagne or lasagna is derived from the word “laganon”, which was the first form of pasta. Laganon was a reference to flat sheets of pasta dough cut into thin strips. As you might expect, Laganon looked very different from what we know to be a typical lasagna dish today. It consisted of layers of pasta and sauce without traditional Italian ingredients. Ancient Rome was known to have a similar dish called “lasanum”, which is Latin for container or pot. Italians used this word to refer to the pot that the dish was served in. Eventually, the dish evolved and took on the same name. The origins of what we know as twisted macaroni came later. <br><br>
            Lasagne is the plural word for one sheet of lasagna and is used regionally throughout Italy. Referencing lasagne or lasagna depends on whether you’re in the northern or southern regions of Italy. The plural form is mostly used in British English, while American English is known to use the singular version <br><br>

In fact, researchers in Britain found a cookbook with a lasagna recipe that dates back to the 1390’s, staking their claim to the first lasagna. <br><br>

            <h1>Gnocchi</h1>
            <p> Gnocchi are a varied family of dumpling in Italian cuisine. They are made of small lumps of dough most traditionally composed of a simple combination of wheat flour, egg, salt, and potato.[9] Variations of the dish exist, where individuals often supplement the simple recipe with flavour additives, such as semolina flour, cheese, breadcrumbs, cornmeal or similar ingredients, and possibly including herbs, vegetables, and other ingredients. Base ingredients may be substituted with alternatives - sweet potatoes for potatoes or rice flour for wheat flour, as examples. Such variations are often considered to be non-traditional.<br><br>
                The dough for gnocchi is most often rolled out before it is cut into small pieces about the size of a wine cork or smaller. The dumplings may be pressed with textured object, such as a fork or a cheese grater to make ridges or cut into little lumps.Professional tools do exist for this purpose, known as a gnocchi board or a cavarola board. Gnocchi are usually eaten as a first course, but they can also be served as a contorno (side dish) to some main courses. <br><br>

            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>The history of Italian gnocchi may be attributed to a number of different sites. While most people associate these dumplings with northern Italy, they can be found all over the peninsula in various forms, made with a variety of base ingredients depending on where they are made: flour, corn meal, semolina, bread, chestnut flour, ricotta, or vegetables ranging from pumpkin to spinach to the traditional potato.<br><br> 
                The name “gnocchi” conjures up memories of potato gnocchi in Italy. Toppings include tomato sauce, meat sauce, basil pesto, cheese fondue, tomato and mozzarella, or plain brown butter and sage, depending on local gourmet preferences.
                Even though they are the most well-known, potato gnocchi are not the only or even the first: the arrival of tubers in Europe took centuries, but the Romans had previously mixed water and flour to produce balls that were then cooked in boiling water.
